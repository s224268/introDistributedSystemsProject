## Importing jSpace in Eclipse
You can use Eclipse to build (and possibly change) jSpace classes. To do that you have only to open Eclipse and select ```File -> Import``` and then select ```Maven -> Existing Maven Projects```. You have to use the wizards to select the jSpace repository and tick all the projects but ```examples/pom.xml``` and ```/pom.xml```.
