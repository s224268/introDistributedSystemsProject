Hi!

This is the sister repo for https://github.com/luucmeldgaard/IntroDistributedProjectApp - see the readme there for more info.
Check out the readme in that repo, too!

Both repos were made for the course 02148 Introduction to Coordination in Distributed Applications.

Note that running two emulators where one hosts the server is a bit difficult. If you want to test multiplayer without multiple android phones, we recommend running the server seperately on the same machine that the emulators are hosted on.

Have fun!
